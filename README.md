# projecteuler

This is a pet project to solve all of the problems I possibly can on Project Euler to the best of my abilites.

I will attempt to implement whatever I learn on my journey to become a proficient programmer.

# Format
Due to the large size of the values which are required to solve Project Euler problems this project will use long as its standard data format in representing signed integers. There there are a few instances in which ints are used, however, for the sake of accessing indices for certain data structures.
